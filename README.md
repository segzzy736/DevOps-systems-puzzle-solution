# systems-puzzle-solution-seye
This is my solution to the devops systems puzzle .
I only started work on this project yesterday 
because I only received the e-mail inviting me to
partcipate two days ago so I wasnt able to give it my 
best shot. Given enough time I would be able to debug 
this code and make it work.
Initially I tried to run docker on aws instance but after considerable
effort I realized that docker cannot be run on the aws instance I 
tried using so I had to look for instances that supports docker, including trying out 
instances on microsoft Azure
however in the process of trying to make this work I ran out
of time since I have to submit this solution by thurday Feb 14th at 12 noon
(eastern). In the process of trying to debug code on aws I learnt a great deal
on how to install docker and docker-compose using powershell as well as 
how to resolve some basic bugs and I got away with a basic understanding of 
docker and container technology after wacthing drummond's video. If I'm given
a few more days I'm very certain I can fix all bugs present in this code
and make it work as it is meant to work.
